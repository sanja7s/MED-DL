MattHarty|0|10|":[ Don't say such things!  Though it makes sense, logically.  Dogs do like to eat to the point of throwing up.  Then they throw up, and eat more.  ""Hunger that consumes all things"" is accurate.  My dog eats dog food, normal food, grass, insects, bones, flowers, flies, and *worse things*.

bgoman|0|4|"Just an officer perspective here. I went to OCS two years out of college. Was making $12/hr in construction and wanted something more. 

If you're looking to give up responsibility, do not commission. It's a lot of pressure/stress and if you go SWO you will have little free time and be responsible for around 20 sailors,  their equipment and all admin associated with that, along with standing regular watches. 

That said, being a SWO is the most rewarding thing I've ever done. 

Also, if you enlist at 27, realize that it might be shocking how far back in your career you may have to go. I'm talking sweepers,  taking out trash, doing all the menial tasks you may think your better than. You get out of that eventually but like others have said,  unless you're shit hot it can take 10 years or more to make E6/E7. You could be serving a 21 year old officer food and cleaning bathrooms with 18 year old high school kids. However, that DOES NOT mean enlisting is bad at all.  There are a lot of folks who enlisted at your age and love it. They like the simplicity of following directions and completing tasks, it gives a great sense of accomplishment. I often think I should have enlisted right out of High school and I wasn't ready for college. 

Lastly, being 27 without a degree means you have to look at the time it will take to complete a degree and get a commission. SWO takes people up to 31 with a waiver I believe but other communities age out at like 28-29. No one can tell you what's right for you though. Good luck!

Curanthir|0|1|So I have a question: Do the Walkure girls actually do anything? From what I remember of the first couple episodes, they sang, but the VFs still had to put down most of the rampaging mechas and stuff themselves, which made me wonder why they didn't just send in a squad of VFs to clean it up without the Walkures. I know the plot reason behind it and that they supposedly counteract the berzerkness or something, but I don't recall seeing that actually work nearly as well as the VF cannons did.|1485546546.0|t1_dczntqb|t1_dcznnw2|Kyle_Dornez|9|Gundam|berzerkness; |

Bakoro|0|7|"&gt;Information isn't stored in our brains in the form of a file with written down text.
    
What brain? She's basically a spirit of intellect. Apparently she *does* have everything like a file in her mind. That's what it seem to be, that's how Jim's presented it so far. The problem is only that you seem to be having a very difficult time thinking outside your own experience and preconceived notions.
Besides, Harry suffered straight-up brain damage from Lash's intervention. 
  
If she was what you seem to think, than she'd either be a floating Dresden, or a floating Lash, or some bizarre amalgam of both. She's not though, she's basically a child, she's seems to be her own ""person"", so, maybe she has the combined memories of her parents, but they aren't *hers*, it's probably more like getting it as a 5D movie.  
 
&gt;She isn't the Archive that gets random fragments of text showed in to her brain without any frame of reference, she gets information with a lifetime of memories and struggle behind them.
  
Fragments nothing. Per Jim the Archive gets it *all*, and she understands it, context and everything.  
    
The Archive also has all her ancestor's memories, including her mother's, and yet she retains an individuality. Bonea and Ivy probably have a lot in common. Seems almost like it was done on purpose that way, even. "|1483902913.0|t1_dc5ze5p|t1_dc5xs6d|Anubissama|3|dresdenfiles|brain damage; |
Bakoro|0|1|"Of all the things, it's just a super weird place to all of a sudden have suspension of disbelief fail you. 

I have no problem at all with Bonea having the full network of Dresden memories, and at the same time, have all of that be totally new and shiny, and not being able to correlate all the contents of her own mind. 

I doubt you have any actual, functional knowledge of how memory works. You might have a mildly educated guess and some observations, but if you actually *knew* how it worked, you'd be the only one in the world.
